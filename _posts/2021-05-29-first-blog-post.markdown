First time writing a blog post. I don't really have anything specific topic on my mind while writing this.

Last 15 months have been an unusual period. Pandemic has impacted almost everyone in one or another way. I personally have been lucky to not being directly
imapcted by pandemic. But the past 15 months has definitely had a big impact on my thought process and introduced me to lot of new stuff. I have been exploring
and learning about lot of new topics in the past year. I never thought I would spend so much time reading about politics but it did happen and now
I do follow politics closely with ton of interest. I am also glad that I finally made some time to learn about investing. There was a period last December
where I used to spend all day just reading some blogposts, subreddits reading something related to investing. I just found it super interesting.
